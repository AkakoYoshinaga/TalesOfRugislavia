Right now I'm dealing with the "engine" of the game, more like about it's core.
The development may be slow but I didn't start with the main storyline yet because I want to figure out how to make things work, but don't worry I have the story waiting in my head, so first of all I'll try to make the game work with the knowledge I have available, be patient because an engine demo may come very soon!

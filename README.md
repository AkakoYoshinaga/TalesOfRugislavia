A tiny text rpg game that I'm developing in C++

Even though still in early development with my basic knowledge, I will upload the game and test builds of it here for people to test it and give me some advice on how I can improve it, if someone is more interested in where I plan to go with this game or wants to teach me more about C++ they are welcome to DM me and give advice, help or just talk about it. Thanks for reading!
